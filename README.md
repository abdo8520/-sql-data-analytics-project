# SQL-data-analytics-project

## 🔍 Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive collection of SQL queries for data exploration, analysis, and reporting. Unlike traditional exploratory analysis, where data structure is first examined, this project takes a direct approach to analysis as the data was already well understood beforehand.
It serves as a practical guide for data analysts, business intelligence (BI) professionals, and developers who want to extract valuable insights from relational databases using SQL efficiently.

# 📊 Project Workflow & Data Analysis Steps
---
## 1️⃣ Direct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Since the data structure was well understood beforehand, the analysis started immediately with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, covering the following key areas:

✅ Database Exploration

  🔹Examining tables, relationships, and data integrity.
  
  🔹Identifying missing or inconsistent data.

✅ Dimensions Exploration

  🔹 Analyzing categorical variables and their impact.
  
  🔹Understanding how different dimensions affect results.

✅ Date Exploration

  🔹Investigating time-based trends and seasonality.
  
  🔹Comparing different time periods for insights.

✅ Measures & Big Numbers Analysis

  🔹Identifying high-impact numerical values.
  
  🔹Calculating averages, medians, and standard deviations.

✅ Ranking & Magnitude Analysis

  🔹Ranking data based on performance metrics.
  
  🔹Categorizing elements based on size and impact.

## 2️⃣ Advanced Data Analytics
Following the exploratory phase, advanced analytical techniques were implemented to extract actionable insights:

📈 Change-Over-Time Trends

  🔹Understanding how data evolves over time.
  
  🔹Detecting seasonality and forecasting future trends.

📊 Cumulative Analysis

  🔹Calculating accumulations for long-term performance tracking.
  
  🔹Applying cumulative metrics to sales, user engagement, and business KPIs.

🚀 Performance Analysis

  🔹Evaluating the performance of different categories, products, or user segments.
  
  🔹Benchmarking business performance against predefined goals.

📌 Part-to-Whole Analysis

  🔹Analyzing the distribution of data among different categories.
  
  🔹Creating proportional insights to understand relationships.

🔍 Data Segmentation

  🔹Dividing data into meaningful clusters.
  
  🔹Using segmentation techniques to identify distinct groups.

📑 Automated Reporting

  🔹Generating dynamic reports with SQL queries.
  
  🔹Creating structured outputs for continuous data monitoring.
